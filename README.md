CRICKTECH


This is the web application which helps to know the statistics about cricket matches which happened. This makes the match understandable with clear data given in the application. This application can be updated with the very recent representation of the data.


This application was made with the help of the front-end languages HTML, CSS, and BOOTSTRAP which are widely used by the developers, and are easily understandable languages with simple syntax.

JAVASCRIPT is a front-end language that is used for the functionality of websites. Libraries of javascript are used by the developers a lot. With the combination of front-end, a back-end should be there to make the website work properly and the backend language used in this application is NODEJS which is one of the most used libraries of the JAVASCRIPT for making servers for the website to function. This is used to access the data from the API.


EJS is another tool that is used in this application that helps to write JAVASCRIPT in HTML files and helps to link the HTML and the JAVASCRIPT. With both front-end and back-end, a database makes the website to be user-friendly and works great and the database used in this application is NoSQL typed database named MongoDB.


The data in this application is taken from some external services using API, which helps to pull the information from the other application or programs to our application. In this application, the data is represented in the form of tables and there are chances to update the application with the updating languages.
